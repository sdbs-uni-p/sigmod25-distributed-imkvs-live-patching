# Data

This directory will store in the `output` sub-directory the generated plots. 

The following files correspond to the following figures in the paper:

- Figure 1: `Synchronization-Time-Teaser.pdf.trim.pdf`
- Figure 5: `Synchronization-Time-Failover-Time.pdf.trim.pdf`
- Figure 6: `Synchronization-Time-Patch-Boxplot-Idle.pdf.trim.pdf`
- Figure 7: `Patch-Duration-RealWorld.pdf.trim.pdf`
  - Please note: Redis real-world patches are crawled based on the *current* git history. Therefore, there may be larger deviations in this chart. 

- Figure 8: `RPS-Time.pdf.trim.pdf`
- Figure 9: `RPS-Time-Single-Details.pdf.trim.pdf`
- Figure 10: `Latencies-Single-Details.pdf.trim.pdf`

**Other Files**: All other figures are referenced in the [README](../../README.md) of this reproduction package. Please note: Files with the same prefix are also the same image; for example, only the white border is trimmed, which can be recognized in the suffix (e.g. `.pdf.trim.pdf`).
