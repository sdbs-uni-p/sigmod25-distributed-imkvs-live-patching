# Transformation

These scripts are responsible for transforming the raw experiment data stored in the `../../data` directory into DuckDB database files. These steps have to be performed with the **regular** Linux kernel:

```
./setup
./do-all
```

The DuckDB database files will be stored in the [../../data](../../data) directory (next to the raw experiment data).
